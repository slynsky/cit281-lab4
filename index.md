## Project Purpose and Components
This lab gave students a chance to work with fastify and creating server files. This involved use of Node, git, and MIME types, among other things.

## What I Learned
Fastify was a bit difficult to grasp at first, but I think it has an inherently sharp learning curve, and this lab was as good an introduction as any, and I believe layed a good foundation for further understanding of it's uses and capabilities.
